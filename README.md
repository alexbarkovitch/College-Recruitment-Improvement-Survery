# College Recruitment Improvement Survey by Alex Barkovitch
This repository contains the ipynb file for the completed project 1 on data visualization as well as the csv files for the 2020 and 2023 student surveys and the cleaned data file for 2023. This project looks at what insights can be drawn from the course survey data to help increase the number of students taking computing classes. I started off by cleaning the survey data file, then analyzing, grouping, and plotting the data to view the trends in the answers given by non-major computer science students. I asked the following questions: 
Question 1: How many people are enrolled in each course?
Question 2: Compare the gender demographics of the different classes who answered the survey. Are there any significant differences?
Question 3: What are the most and least common ways people heard about CCM?
Question 4: What are the most and least common motivations for people to seek a computing class at CCM?
Question 5: What is the average value for the question “On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being not at all interested and 5 being extremely interested, how interested are you taking more courses in Computer Science, Information Technology or Game Development?” and how do the results compare from different years of the survey?
If you'd like to know the answers to these questions, be sure to check out the project file!
